# Autonomous Form Assistant - AI-First CRM HCP Module

An intelligent, stateful CRM assistant designed for Healthcare Representatives to log interactions with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) through natural conversation. Powered by **FastAPI**, **React**, **Redux**, and **LangGraph**, this application demonstrates a seamless "AI-First" architecture where a stateful agent drives the user interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI-Driven Form Automation:** Use natural language to populate complex forms instantly.
- **Surgical State Updates:** Tell the AI to change specific fields (e.g., "Change the sentiment to positive") without affecting other data.
- **LangGraph Multi-Tool Agent:** A stateful agent with 5 specialized tools:
  1. `get_hcp_list`: Fetches real-time doctor data from PostgreSQL.
  2. `get_product_list`: Retrieves available products from the database.
  3. `log_interaction`: Extracts structured entities from conversational text.
  4. `edit_interaction`: Performs precise updates on specific Redux state fields.
  5. `submit_interaction`: Finalizes and persists data to the database.
- **Real-time UI Synchronization:** Full Redux Toolkit integration ensuring the form "listens" to the AI's thoughts.
- **Granular Notifications:** Individual Toast notifications (via `react-toastify`) for every field changed by the AI.
- **Professional Split-Screen Layout:** Independent scrolling for the AI chat panel and the interaction form.

## 🧪 Testing the AI

Navigate to the `materials/exhaustive_test_cases.txt` file for a detailed walkthrough of prompts.

**Quick Test:**

1. Type: _"Who are the doctors?"_ (Verify Tool 1)
2. Type: _"I met Dr. Smith today for a call. Sentiment was positive."_ (Verify Tool 3 & Form Sync)
3. Type: _"Actually, it was Dr. Emily and the sentiment was neutral."_ (Verify Tool 4 - Surgical Edit)
4. Type: _"Save this interaction."_ (Verify Tool 5 - Database Persistence)

_This project was built as a technical assignment for [HCP Interaction Module]._

Who are the doctors in our system?

What products do we have?

I had a meeting with Dr. Emily today at 2 PM. Dr. John and Nurse Joy were also there. We talked about Product Y market entry. The doctor was very
interested, so we agreed to start a trial next month. I need to send the trial protocols by Monday. The overall vibe was positive.

Add Dr. Smith to the attendees.

Actually, remove Dr. John and only keep Dr. Smith and Dr. Emily as attendees.

Change the time to 9 AM.

This looks good, please save it.
